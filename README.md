# <span style="color:#ef00ff">CodePen-liteðŸ”—

Hey folks ðŸš€,<br>
I have created a codepen (an online coding platform for <b>HTML, CSS & JS </b>) like online code editor.<br>
Just like CodePen, you can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets and see the live results.
You can also save your project to firestore.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,react,redux,tailwind,firebase)](https://skillicons.dev)
 #### <span style="color:#ef00ff">1. HTML  
<ul> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides a structured way to define the content and layout of a webpage.</ul>

 #### <span style="color:#ef00ff">2. CSS  
<ul>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to define the visual presentation of web pages written in HTML. It allows developers to control aspects like layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and responsiveness. Some custom css were used for animation and effects.</ul>

#### <span style="color:#ef00ff">3. REACT
<ul>React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.It allows developers to create reusable components that represent different parts of a web application. These components can be combined to form complete screens, pages, or entire apps. React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows developers to write HTML-like markup directly in their JavaScript code </ul>

#### <span style="color:#ef00ff">4. REDUX
<ul>
Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React. It provides a centralized store to manage application state, making it easier to handle complex data flows and interactions. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, where actions trigger state changes, and components subscribe to the store to receive updates. 
</ul> 

#### <span style="color:#ef00ff">5. TAILWIND CSS
<ul> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes. These classes enable rapid styling without writing custom CSS, promoting consistency and scalability</ul>

#### <span style="color:#ef00ff">4. FIREBASE
<ul>Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provided by Google. It offers developers a suite of tools and services to build high-quality apps, expand their user base, and generate revenue. Built on Googleâ€™s infrastructure, Firebase includes features like databases, authentication, cloud functions, and integration for various platforms.</ul>

## ðŸ“Œ <span style="color:#29c4f6">Future Scope
  1. We can work on viewing project details like code by clicking on the  particular project. 
  2. We can provide support for other languages. 
  3. We can have a collection page where we can display our bookmarked projects.
